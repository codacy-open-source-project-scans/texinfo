They are all free software, but not officially part of Texinfo, and the
Texinfo maintainers don't support them (and generally have no knowledge
about them, just passing them on).

The two txipsfonts-* files are attempts by Torsten Bronger and 
Stephen Gildea, respectively, to use base PostScript fonts instead
of Computer Modern, in the simplest way.  (I could not find the right
version of the original texinfo.tex on which Torsten's file was based.)

The perldoc-all subdirectory is about making Texinfo out of the standard
Perl *.pod files.
